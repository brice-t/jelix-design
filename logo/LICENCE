All logos of Jelix are released under this licence:

You may reuse the Jelix logo only to designate the jelix project. The logo should be show
with a reference to the Jelix project, at least with its name, and the URL of the project.
For example, you can display the logo on your web site, with a link on the image,
to http://jelix.org. On a paper, the URL could be in foot notes.

If you modify the logo, you must respect colours as much as possible, and retain
the original proportions if you apply scaling on it.
